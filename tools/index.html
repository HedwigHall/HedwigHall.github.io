<p>Welcome to hh.tools<br>
This is a treasure trove of usefull things.<br>
<a href="/tools/clock/">hh.tools.clock</a> is a page that has a big clock. It's a clock. What more could be asked for?<br>
<a href="/tools/notepad/">hh.tools.notepad</a> is a page that text can be typed in, and text can be pasted in. Eventually <code>CTRL+S</code> will save the text to the url.<br>
<a href="/tools/whiteboard/">hh.tools.whiteboard</a> is a page that can be drawn on with a finger or a mouse. The colors, and sizes can be changed in the context menu.<br>
<a href="/tools/stopwatch/">hh.tools.stopwatch</a> is a page that is a quick and dirty stopwatch. Eventually it will have a lap timer as well.<br>
