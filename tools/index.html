<p>Welcome to hh.Tools<br>
This is a treasure trove of usefull things.<br>
<a href="/Tools/Clock/">hh.Tools.Clock</a> is a page that has a big clock. It's a clock. What more could be asked for?<br>
<a href="/Tools/Notepad/">hh.Tools.Notepad</a> is a page that text can be typed in, and text can be pasted in. Eventually <code>CTRL+S</code> will save the text to the url.<br>
<a href="/Tools/Whiteboard/">hh.Tools.Whiteboard</a> is a page that can be drawn on with a finger or a mouse. The colors, and sizes can be changed in the context menu.<br>
