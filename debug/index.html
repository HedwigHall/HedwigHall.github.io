<div>
<p>Welcome to hh.debug<br>
This is a treasure trove full of tools to fix things.<br>
The debug-grid has been moved to <a href="/debug/debug-grid">hh.debug.debug-grid</a>, because it became obsolete by <a href="/debug/multi-grid">hh.debug.multi-grid</a><br>
<a href="/debug/debug-grid">hh.debug.debug-grid</a> is a page that has a few things for formating. It used to be housed at this url<br>
<a href="/debug/multi-grid">hh.debug.multi-grid</a> is a page that populates itself with all pages (except <a href="/debug/debug-grid">hh.debug.debug-grid</a> and this page)<br>
<a href="/debug/inputs">hh.debug.inputs</a> is a page that has a lot of inputs on it, for CSS testing purposes.<br>
<a href="/debug/markdown">hh.debug.markdown</a> is a page (mostly for my reference) that has all GitHub-flavored markdown things.<br>
<a href="/debug/text">hh.debug.text</a> is a page that is just filled with text. Like this page, except it has more text, and it has numbers, and it doesn't have links.<br>
</p>
</div>
