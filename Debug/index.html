  <div>
<p>Welcome to hh.Debug<br>
This is a treasure trove full of tools to fix things.<br>
The DebugGrid has been moved to <a href="/Debug/DebugGrid">hh.Debug.DebugGrid</a>, because it became obsolete by <a href="/Debug/MultiGrid">hh.Debug.MultiGrid</a><br>
<a href="/Debug/DebugGrid">hh.Debug.DebugGrid</a> is a page that has a few things for formating. It used to be housed at this url<br>
<a href="/Debug/MultiGrid">hh.Debug.MultiGrid</a> is a page that populates itself with all pages (except <a href="/Debug/DebugGrid">hh.Debug.DebugGrid</a> and this page)<br>
<a href="/Debug/Inputs">hh.Debug.Inputs</a> is a page that has a lot of inputs on it, for CSS testing purposes.<br>
<a href="/Debug/Markdown">hh.Debug.Markdown</a> is a page (mostly for my reference) that has all GitHub-flavored markdown things.<br>
<a href="/Debug/Text">hh.Debug.Text</a> is a page that is just filled with text. Like this page, except it has more text, and it has numbers, and it doesn't have links.<br>
  </p>
  </div>
